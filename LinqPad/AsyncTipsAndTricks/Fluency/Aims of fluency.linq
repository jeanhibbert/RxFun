/* AIMS OF FLUENCY

1. Single expression instead of multiple statements
2. Compositional - fluent methods return types that allow further chaining
3. Functional - fluent methods don't typically mutate subject

With generic types, fluency is a powerful tool for removing clutter and unnecessary concerns.
